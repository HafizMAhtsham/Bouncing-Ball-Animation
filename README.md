Task Description

Create a web page that displays a simple animation of bouncing balls. You need to implement JavaScript logic to handle the animation.

Requirements
Create an HTML file with a canvas element that covers the entire window.

Using JavaScript, draw a ball on the canvas.

Implement animation logic to make the ball bounce within the canvas.

The ball should change color each time it hits the canvas boundary.

Allow the user to add more balls to the canvas by clicking on it.
Constraints

The balls should bounce off the canvas boundaries smoothly.

The color of each ball should change randomly on collision with the boundary.

Use object-oriented programming concepts to organize your code.

You can use any additional libraries if needed, or implement everything using native JavaScript.
